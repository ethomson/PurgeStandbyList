PurgeStandbyList
================

Purges the "standby list", which is the operating system's caching
mechanism.

This is probably not adviseable for general use, but it may be helpful
if you need a cold disk cache, for whatever reason.

You can see the results in [SysInternals
RAMMap](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff700229.aspx).

This must be run as Administrator.
